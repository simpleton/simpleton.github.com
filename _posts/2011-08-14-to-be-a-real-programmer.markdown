That is the different between a great coder and normal one. I had met that issue once. Rocket Chen & I ported the usbnet system to the company`s platform, the target device always cloud not ping the host(PC). It should be the internal DMA (within the USB system designed by synopsis) cloud not carry the unaligned address buffer.

On Yun Feng `s blog commits, the 13rd commit tell three method to fix the bug. That is really useful~
